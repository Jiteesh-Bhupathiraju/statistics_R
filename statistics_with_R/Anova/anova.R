# what can we do to compare multiple group means. can run about the variance of data
# if we use the multi t testing, 1 - (1-alpha)^no of variables we are comparing

# ANOVA
# analysis of variance

# One way - ANOVA
#-> One categorical variable, one numerical variable and wanted to know how the each
# category effects the variance

# assumptions 
# indep, random selection, approx normal, and variances ~


# Post hoc test to know which one is different 
# Tukey HSD

# if we run multiple tests, the anova will have a chance of rejecting the hypothesis by 0.05
# if run multiple tests then its 1 - (1-alpha)^tests




# Two way ANOVA
# -------------
# if one categorical on the numerical is moderted by gender
# sees if the means in each categorical are equal, and then find if there is an inetraction
