# 1. Random Sample
# 2. Independent Observations
# 3. count of a variable >1 and 20% of cells < count 5

# x2 =  (ob-exp)2/exp

# goodnesss to fit
# so now we get to choose, what percentage are we expecting there, as there might be some conditions
# we can manipulate the way we want

# Chi sqaure goodness of fit
# --------------------------
# by changing the required probabilities



# Chi square - test of independence
# ------------------------------------
# Hypothesis: Relative proportions of one variable are independent of another
# for expected we can go by the marginal values and then the normal division

# Have to be careful that, if our assumptions are met, or but even met to hwo far these 
# get is the quesiton, even though there are no, if they dont make necessary cotribution
# what is the use of those?
